Step 2: Co-occurrence Classification

This module processes the co-occurrence matrix generated in Step 1. It filters 
term pairs based on a frequency threshold (100 occurrences) to remove statistical 
noise, eliminates symmetric duplicates, and produces a ranked classification file.
The output serves as input for semantic mapping in Step 3.
